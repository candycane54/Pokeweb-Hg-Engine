step 1: expand move narc a/0/2/1
step 2: expand move info text banks [16 * 3,402,403, 488]

step 3: expand battle animation narc a/0/6/6 with data from move animation narc starting at move id 559



In fact, every move after 559 gets a battle effect from NARC a/0/6/7 in BW (move effects; which is a/0/6/6 in B2W2, and move animations is a/0/6/5 in B2W2). So if you want to add new moves, add the animations to this NARC starting at move ID 659.
